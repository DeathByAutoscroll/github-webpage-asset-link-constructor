# github-webpage-asset-link-constructor
This is a very cobbled together and hardcoded script to generate USERNAME.github.io links for locally downloaded files. It requires hardcoding directory information into the script, as well as the username you wish to achieve. By default it only finds .gif files however this should be changed to whatever you need it to find.

Tested for python 3.11.2, this will NOT be maintained.
